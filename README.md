 # Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata â€“ GitHub Copilot Workshop Edition

Welcome to the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata, now adapted for a hands-on GitHub Copilot workshop!

This version is designed to help you practice and master the use of GitHub Copilot for real-world software engineering tasks: understanding legacy code, generating new features, writing and fixing tests, refactoring, documenting, and migrating code across languages.

This workshop leverages the Gilded Rose Kata as a multi-language playground for Copilot. You will:
- Use Copilot to explain and understand legacy code
- Implement new features using Copilot
- Write and improve tests with Copilot
- Introduce and fix bugs with Copilot
- Refactor and document code with Copilot
- Migrate code between languages with Copilot

All exercises are designed to be solved in a maximum of two Copilot prompts per step. See the `exercises_en.md` (or `exercices.md` for French) for the full workshop sequence and instructions.

Whether you are new to Copilot or want to push its limits, this kata will help you build practical Copilot skills in a safe, iterative, and language-agnostic environment.
